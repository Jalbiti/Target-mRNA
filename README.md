# mRNA Target Sequence Prediction for siRNA Efficacy

This repository is dedicated to developing a machine learning model that predicts target sequences within mRNA for optimizing 
siRNA efficacy. The project is structured for reproducibility and scalability, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (ML/DL)
- Jupyter Notebook support
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Explore and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and modeling
- `src/` – Source code for data processing and modeling
- `data/` – Input datasets (add your data here)
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
